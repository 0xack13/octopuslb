Octopus Load Balancer v1.14 - http://octopuslb.sourceforge.net/

Quick start guide
=================

To build Octopus you will need:
- GNU make
- GCC
- Linux kernel version 2.6 (or 2.4 with epoll support)
- (optional) net-snmp development libraries (on redhat this package is called net-snmp-devel)

Quick start

$ tar zxvf octopuslb-1.14.tar.gz
$ cd octopuslb-1.14s
$ ./configure (if you're compiling with SNMP support)
OR
$ ./configure --disable-snmp (if compiling without SNMP support)
$ make 
$ make install

That's it! 

Two binaries (octopuslb-server and octopuslb-admin) are installed in /usr/local/sbin and the default configuration file (octopuslb.conf) is installed to /usr/local/etc

Edit and change any parameters in the configuration file such as IP and port values then start the server like this
$ octopuslb-server -c /usr/local/etc/octopuslb.conf

You can then connect using the client interace by using the client
$ octopuslb-admin

NB: The server process will try to create a directory to put an SHM placeholder file. By default this is /var/run/octopuslb. Make sure that the user that is trying to run octopuslb-server has these rights, alternatively (but not recommended), make this directory now and chmod to 1777.

Extras
======

Take a look at the /extras directory for some init.d, systemd, logrotate and RPM .spec files if you want to build or package OctopusLB. 

Enjoy!
